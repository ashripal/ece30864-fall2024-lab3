1. Pros:

Break down of projects into several steps leads to a more iterative approach to solving a bigger problem, creating more organization in the process

Supports constant collaboration with customers



Cons:

When teams work on each component in different cycles, the complete output often becomes very fragmented rather than one cohesive unit

The “see-as-you-go” nature of Agile makes it difficult to split into meaningful steps per cycle

2. The scrum master is in charge of all tasks related to Jira tooling, facilitating sprints and meetings, and standups. On the other hand, the product owner sets direction for the team, handles release and stakeholder management.

3. Sprint planning meeting:

Determine what needs to be completed in the next sprint

Move stories in sprint scope from backlog

Daily scrum/standup meeting:

Team members discuss work completed

This meeting happens every day of the sprint and any blocks on tasks are discussed

Sprint retrospective meeting:

Discuss completed work and move incomplete work to backlog

This meeting occurs at the end of the sprint, which may be closed

4. Epic: captures the overall work that is then broken down in several smaller tasks

Story: a software system requirement that is expressed in a few short sentences

Bug: smallest unit of work, mentions blocks along the way

Task issue: a unit of work that can be tracked through a workflow
