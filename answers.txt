1. Pros:

Break down of projects into several steps leads to a more iterative approach to solving a bigger problem, creating more organization in the process

Supports constant collaboration with customers



Cons:

When teams work on each component in different cycles, the complete output often becomes very fragmented rather than one cohesive unit

The “see-as-you-go” nature of Agile makes it difficult to split into meaningful steps per cycle

2. The scrum master is in charge of all tasks related to Jira tooling, facilitating sprints and meetings, and standups. On the other hand, the product owner sets direction for the team, handles release and stakeholder management.
