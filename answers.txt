1. Pros:

Break down of projects into several steps leads to a more iterative approach to solving a bigger problem, creating more organization in the process

Supports constant collaboration with customers



Cons:

When teams work on each component in different cycles, the complete output often becomes very fragmented rather than one cohesive unit

The “see-as-you-go” nature of Agile makes it difficult to split into meaningful steps per cycle
